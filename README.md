# CI Templates

## Introduction

This repository contains our reusable GitHub actions and CI/CD templates. These actions are designed to standardize and streamline our development workflows across multiple projects.

## About

Our reusable GitHub actions help teams:
- Maintain consistent CI/CD practices
- Reduce duplication across repositories
- Ensure standardized deployment and testing procedures
- Speed up development cycles with pre-built automation

## Usage

To use these actions in your workflows, reference them in your `.github/workflows` files using the standard GitHub Actions syntax:

TODO: Add real world examples

## Contributing

When adding new actions or updating existing ones, please ensure they follow our established patterns and include appropriate documentation.
